            <p>In the November 1958 American Rifleman, Charles Yust had a three page article on the 9mm 
                Parabellum cartridge which illustrated 27 headstamps and listed 110 headstamp codes, many 
                of which never appeared on a 9mm Parabellum cartridge. I was fascinated by the variety of 
                headstamps and loads and began accumulating 9mm Para cartridges at the tender age of 17; I 
                have now documented over 2500 headstamps and almost 15,000 loads and variations, as you
                can see in the <a href="{% url 'dashboard' '9mmP' %}">online 9mm Parabellum database.</a>
                A very good collection that doesn’t include date variations would be about 1000 specimens, 
                and a truly outstanding collection would number over 2500.</p>
            <p>This guide explores the origins, development, and various types of 9mm Parabellum 
                ammunition. It is designed as a primer for starting 9mm collectors and as an educational 
                resource for collectors at all levels.</p>

    <h2 id="origin" class="mt-5">Origin of the 9mm Parabellum Cartridge</h2>
    <p>The 9mm Parabellum cartridge was originally developed by George Luger, at the German company Deutsche Waffen- und Munitionsfabriken
        (DWM). In early 1902, George Luger, through the British conglomerate Vickers Limited, offered a 9mm version of his pistol
        to the Small Arms Committee. In mid-1903, three Luger prototype pistols in 9mm were delivered to the US
        Army for testing at Springfield Arsenal. These are the first pistols known to be chambered for the 9mm
        Parabellum cartridge. An additional 50 pistols in 9mm, along with 25,000 rounds of ammunition, were
        provided the US Army for testing in April 1904. The first evidence of German military interest in a 9mm
        version of the Luger was in March 1904. The caliber was used extensively, initially in
        pistols, and then in machine pistols (submachine guns) produced by Germany in World War
        I.</p>
    <p>A reduced power version of the cartridge was introduced in Italy in 1910 for the 9mm
        Glisenti pistol and later used in machine pistols. Figure 1 illustrates a sectioned 9mm Glisenti
        showing the wad on top of the powder to fill the case. During this time frame, 9mm pistols
        were adopted by a number of other countries including Holland and Bulgaria. After World
        War I, the caliber spread rapidly with the widespread development of the machine pistol,
        most of which were chambered for this caliber. Pistols and machine pistols chambered for
        9mm Parabellum were also introduced in a number of countries including Belgium, Bulgeria,
        Czechoslovakia, Finland, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland before World War II. Today,
        the 9mm Parabellum cartridge has been manufactured by or for more than 80 different
        countries, with very significant production by 27 countries. It has truly become the world’s standard pistol
        and machine pistol cartridge. It remains the standard pistol caliber for NATO and for the military in most
        other countries in the world</p>

    <h2 id="loads" class="mt-5">Loads</h2>
    <p>During over 100 years of use, the 9mm Parabellum
        cartridges have been manufacturered with a wide variety
        of loads. The vast majority of these are full-metal jacket
        (FMJ) ball loads with solid bullets. In addition to these
        standard ball loads a wide variety of loads have been
        produced to include tracers, blanks, dummies and proof
        loads, as well as exotic loads for special police usage,
        duplex & triplex loads, squeeze bore loads, shot loads
        and tubular bullets to list just a few.</p>
    <p>Some bullets are
        marked on the base, particularly pre-WW I German bullets and some British bullets made before WW II.
        The markings illustrated in Figure 2 are all German. Note that “278F” is the DWM designation for the
        truncated cone bullet. Below is an overview of some of the loads encountered in 9mm Parabellum.</p>

        Below is an overview of some of the loads encountered in 9mm Parabellum.

    <h4 class="mt-5">Ball Loads</h2>
    <p>The earliest loads have FMJ truncated
        cone bullets weighing 124 grains. These were replaced in Germany with 124 grain full metal 
        jacket (FMJ) bullets featuring a rounded nose profile—technically known as a “round ogive”—in 
        1915–1916 (Figure 3), though truncated cone bullets continued to be used in commercial loads 
        in the United States into the 1930s.
        Later, round nose FMJ 115 grain bullets,
        usually having a concave base, were introduced by a
        number of countries including Britain (Figure 4).</p>

    <p>During the early stages of World War II, Germany developed two new bullets in an attempt to
        conserve lead. The first of these bullets was
        designated the 08mE (for mit Eisenkern) or “with
        iron core”. As shown in the illustration the normal
        lead core is replaced by an iron core with lead
        around the base of the iron core. This bullet was
        initially identified by the black bullet jacket, but in
        1944 it became the standard German ball load and the blackened bullet
        jacket was dropped. The second of these bullets
        was made by compressing iron powder at high temperature into a solid
        material known as Sintered Iron or Sintered Eisen. This was designated 
        as the 08SE bullet and is identified by its dark gray color. The SE bullet
        was introduced into general service in 1943.</p>

        </figure>

        <p>Until recently, the Swiss ball load used a bullet with a deep groove to facilitate a 
            case crimp to hold the bullet in place. Figure 6 illustrates this bullet and a WW II Swiss 
            ball load with an aluminum case.</p>

        <p>During World War II the Germans produced a special load with a 150gr FMJ bullet and subsonic velocity 
            for use with silencers. These loads are identified by a green lacquered steel case or by an "X" on 
            the headstamp. The British developed similar subsonic loads after the war, some with bullets up 
            to 170gr, often marked by colored case head dots.</p>

        <h4 class="mt-5">Hollow Point & Soft Point</h4>
        <p>In addition to FMJ loads, 9mm Parabellum has been produced with hollow point and soft point bullets. DWM created hollow-point bullets for colonial troops before WWI. Modern variants for law enforcement and civilian use are common, particularly in the US. A unique design known as a “Pingrabber,” with a sawtooth tip, was used in bowling pin shooting competitions.</p>

        </figure>

        <h4 class="mt-5">Tracer Loads</h4>
        <p>Early tracer load development began before WWI, though no specimens from that era survive. Tracers became more widespread after WWII, with France leading postwar production. Colored bullet tips (red, green) are typical identifiers. Tracers were produced for signaling, training, and night operations.</p>

        </figure>
    
        <h4 class="mt-5">Dummy Loads</h4>
        <p>Inert dummy (or drill cartridges) have been produced from the earliest days of the 9mm
            Parabellum for use in training and handling practice. The DWM listing of casetypes illustrates a dummy load as one of the earliest of the DWM
            products in 9mm Parabellum. World War I German dummy loads (or Exercizer Patronen) were generally
            overall with a hollow bullet jacket making them very light weight. Between the wars, Germany introduced
            another style of dummy with no primer pocket and only a small dimple in the base. This style dummy
            sometimes has four holes in the case. In 1940, Germany introduced plastic dummies with a steel head in
            both black and red plastic. Both varieties occur with and without
            headstamps. The Polte headstamped black plastic dummy
            is quite scarce. The red plastic dummies with the “lpk” headstamp
            are seldom encountered and the “ay” and “nts” headstamped dummies are quite rare.</p>
        <figure class="text-center my-4">

        </figure>
    
        <p>During World War II Australia, Canada and Britain produced a variety of dummies, and Winchester
            produced dummy loads on contract for Britain during the war. Some of
            these dummy loads used a wooden spacer (sometimes painted red)
            inside the case to prevent the bullet from being forced into the case by
            repeated usage. The spacer can often be seen through the case holes.
            Dummies for both military and commercial usage have been produced world wide, and an interesting
            collection can be put together which consists entirely of 9mm Parabellum dummies.</p>

        <h4 class="mt-5">Blank Loads</h4>
        <p>During the 1920s and 1930s, a number of German companies produced a wide variety of commercial blanks. One notable example is a Geco blank with a red paper bullet filled with iron powder to provide sufficient weight to operate the action. Another rare German blank from this period features a mercury-filled wooden bullet. These early blanks are often unheadstamped and vary in construction and materials.</p>
        <figure class="text-center my-4">
            <img src="{% static 'collection/images/nine_mm_guide/Fig_14.png' %}" class="img-fluid" style="width: 42%;" alt="Fig 14: German commercial blanks">

        </figure>

        <p>The German military, up through the end of World War II, made relatively little use of blank ammunition in 9mm Parabellum. However, in the 1920s and 1930s, Polte manufactured small batches of blanks using blue wood or red paper bullets. DWM also experimented with blanks before and during WWI, although no surviving specimens are known. There is no record of the Germans using blanks in 9mm during WWII.</p>
        <figure class="text-center my-4">

        </figure>

        <p>In the United States, short-case and full-length blanks were made primarily by Stenbridge 
            for use in movies. After WWII, Britain and France produced a variety of blanks, with the 
            French developing a distinctive style using a single molded plastic case and bullet with a 
            cast aluminum head. Standard French military blanks were white plastic, but variants were 
            produced in other colors, including bronze-colored blanks made for the film 
            <em>The Longest Day</em>. Some blanks were experimental and used plastic of various levels 
            of opacity and translucency.</p>
        <figure class="text-center my-4">

        <p>The “Paulet” blank is a French innovation featuring a white plastic bullet-shaped insert 
            that extends into the case and is crimped in place. These blanks were loaded into both 
            aluminum and brass cases and are now prized by collectors.</p>
        <figure class="text-center my-4">

        <p>Sweden adopted a red plastic blank after WWII with a deep recess in the base. These were 
            designed for use with a bore restrictor device, which crushed the bullet on firing and 
            raised pressure to ensure cycling. Over time, case mouth seals evolved from unsealed to 
            blue, then black in the late 1960s. Most Swedish blanks were loaded into previously fired cases.</p>

        <p>The Danes began producing blanks in the 1950s, initially using plain white or red wood bullets. 
            Later, they adopted a red plastic bullet in the Swedish style. In the 1960s, Denmark introduced 
            an extended blank barrel with a modified chamber to prevent live ammunition from chambering. 
            Blanks from this era feature 21mm cases, which drop too far into the modified chamber to be fired.</p>

        <p>Fabrique Nationale (FN) in Belgium has produced a wide variety of full-length blanks since WWII 
            for both commercial and military use. Many of these blanks were manufactured for specific 
            contracts or applications.</p>

        <h4 class="mt-5">Proof Loads</h4>
        <p>Most countries that produce weapons chambered for 9mm Parabellum also manufacture special 
            high-pressure proof loads. These are used to verify the strength and safety of firearms. 
            The markings on proof ammunition varies from country to country and over time within a 
            single country. German WW I proof ammunition was frequently only identified on the box label, 
            though some had a special headstamp (Figure 21). During WW II German proof loads were identified 
            by a green painted base, and after the war the Germans generally knurled the rim of proof loads.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>A number of countries, use a red painted base, or red markings on the base to identify a proof load. The
            US usually uses a tinned case, with or without a red case head and red bullet. Canada identifies the proof
            loads with nickel-plated cases or blackened cases. Both Britain and Belgium use copperwashed cases to
            identify proof loads. The Czech Republic uses red case heads on nickelled cases, and also uses green case
            heads to identify proof loads. Given the variations in marking proof loads, loads with unusual markings
            should <strong>never</strong> be shot. Failure to follow this simple rule can destroy a valuable firearm, and could result in
            serious injury to the shooter.</p>

        <h4 class="mt-5">Special Loads</h4>
        <p>Special-purpose loads encompass a broad category, including short-range training ammunition, 
            armor-penetrating rounds, exotic police designs, signal cartridges, and experimental projectiles.</p>
        <p>The shortrange training loads are of particular interest. The Swedish army
            adopted a version of the blank described earlier, but, instead of the red plastic
            bullet, the short range load has a black plastic bullet with a 3mm steel ball in
            the tip (Figure 23, left) which will pass through the blank adapter described earlier.
            Norway experimented with an all plastic version of this round (Figure 23, right).</p>

            <figcaption class="text-muted small mt-2"><strong>Fig. 23:</strong> Swedish and Norwegian short-range training rounds.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The Canadians also produce quite a variety of training cartridges, including
            rounds with plastic bullets (Figure 25) intended to fire in a special barrel and
            paint ball cartridges which can be used with the same special reduced caliber
            barrel. Note the paintball cartridge with the steel collar. This is an experimental
            load with a 9mm bullet. This approach was dropped in favor of a reduced
            caliber barrel for training which would not accept a normal 9mm Parabellum cartridge.</p>

            <figcaption class="text-muted small mt-2"><strong>Fig. 25:</strong> Canadian paintball and plastic training rounds, including an experimental steel-collared round.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Belgium has also done quite a bit of experimentation with short range cartridges. Figure 26 illustrates a set of
            experimental projectiles which were tested by Belgium in the early 1980s. Note that all of these projectiles
            have a skirt or other technique to increase drag and reduce the range of the projectile.</p>

        </figure>
    
        <p>Besides the training ammunition there are such odd and exotic cartridges as 
            the set of flare signal cartridges illustrated in Figure 27.
            These cartridges were developed by DELA Industries in California in
            the late 1960s for use in survival kits and similar applications. They
            were made with yellow, green and red flares. Similar smoke single
            cartridges were also produced. The amount of smoke available in a
            9mm projectile must be extremely limited and the utility of these loads
            remains questionable. Germany also experimented with signal cartridges in
            9mm Parabellum.</p>

        </figure>
    
        <p>Another interesting load is the squeeze-bore multiball load
            developed by Colt for Israel in the 1960s. The concept was
            a taper-bore barrel on a Uzi machine pistol firing loads which
            had three projectiles in a plastic jacket. Initially, the cartridges
            were 9mm, but were squeezed as they transited the barrel to
            a smaller caliber. The process created three separate small
            caliber, high velocity projectiles from each round fired. The
            load appears to have been intended for short range work
            (Figure 28).The Isrealis developed another load for similiar
            applications. This load has steel shot encased in an amber plastic
            matrix so that each cartridge sent a spray of steel balls out
            the barrel (Figure 29).</p>

        <p>The Swedish army also tested a squeeze bore maching pistol in the same time-
            frame. In this case the loads were a single bullet in each case. The barrel
            tapered from 9mm to 6.5mm and test loads were produced with both steel
            and copper projectiles (Figure 30). These loads are seldom encountered
            today.</p>

        <p>Since the introduction of the 9mm Parabellum cartridge, and
            particularly since the end of WW II, there has been quite a bit
            of development work designing projectiles which have enhanced 
            penetration over the standard ball cartridge in 9mm
            Parabellum. One of the early attempts was a load for an
            experimental Hi-Standard pistol tested by the USAF. The
            experimental ammunition can still be found on occasion, and the
            majority of the loads used a turned steel bullet or a sintered iron
            bullet for enhanced penetration (Figure 31).</p>


    
        <p>The Swedish army adopted an enhanced penetration ball load in
            the 1960s. The bullet was of normal construction with a steel jacket which was
            thickened in the front to provide for improved penetration. This load was pro-
            duced into the 1990s and was sold commercially in the US by Norma in the late
            1970s (Figure 32).</p>

        <p>In the 1970s, France began the development of enhanced penetration projectiles in 9mm Parabellum and
            other calibers. They adopted a very different approach using a very light weight copper-alloy projectile with
            a unique spire point. These projectiles were known as Tres (Very) High Velocity or THV loads. The detail
            design of the projectile varied considerably and many variations of the bullet can be found (Figure 33).</p>

        <p>This design found favor in South Africa where it was produced. Over time the design has been modified by
            the South Africians and a plastic cap has been added to the bullet tip to improving feeding in an automatic
            weapon (Figure 34).</p>

        <p>The variety of special loads in 9mm Parabellum could fill a book on their own,
            but one more round bears mention. German law prohibits the police from using
            hollow point ammunition. To provide police units, particularly special police units
            with effective ammunition, considerable development has been done to develop
            effective police loads that do not have hollow point bullets. One of the results of
            this development are the bullets pictured in Figure 35. These are solid copper-
            alloy bullets with plastic caps. The caps make them solid point when fired, but
            the hole through the bullet allows the barrel pressure to eject the plastic tip and
            the solid bullet body is designed for the ideal combination of penetration and
            stopping power.</p>

        <h2 id="headstamps" class="mt-5">Headstamps</h2>
        <p>The headstamp is the key to understanding a 9mm Parabellum cartridge. It can tell you which country 
            and company produced the round or case. The headstamp may tell you whether it is a
            commercial, military or police load, when it was manufactured, how it was manufactured, who provided the
            metal used in the case, the load or the case design. The code on the headstamp is important and the 
            <a href="https://cartridgecollectors.org/"> IAA website</a> 
            contains a listing of headstamp codes which include all of the codes
            illustrated in this paper. The listing identifies the manufacturer and country of origin. The codes are not
            unique and must be considered within the context of the entire cartridge. A “13” at the top of a headstamp
            may mean it was manfactured in Castro’s Cuba, or it could identify the type of load on ammunition manufactured 
            in the Republic of South Africa. Illustrated below are some of the headstamps which may be
            encountered on 9mm Parabellum cartridges. The code associated with each headstamp below
            is the identification code used in the

    <h2 id="cases" class="mt-5">Case Materials</h2>
    <p>Although usually Brass, 9mm cases have been manufactured from various materials.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-5">Brass</h4>
    <p>The vast majority of 9mm cartridges produced since 1902 have had cases made of brass. The brass
        cases have sometimes been plated with nickel for identification or to make them
        more durable.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-5">Steel</h4>
    <p>The Germans experimented with copper-washed steel cases during World One, did not put this
        case design into production. The steel cases were washed (coated) with copper to prevent corrosion and to
        ease extraction of the fired case. The most significant production of 9mm Parabellum steel cases occurred in
        Germany, and the occupied countries during World War Two. In the late 1930s Germany began production
        of steel cases in an effort to save brass for higher priority applications. In 1939 they began production of
        copper-washed steel-case ammunition in 9mm Parabellum, and in 1940 began converting to steel cases
        lacquered a dark gray. These lacquered steel cases continued in massive production by German factories to
        and end of the war, practically to the exclusion of brass case 9mm Parabellum ammunition. The Czech
        factories which were occupied during the war continued to produce these lacquered steel cases into the
        early 1950s. The French also produced 9mm Parabellum ammunition with lacquered steel cases from the
        end of the war through mid-1960. The US tested steel cases in 9mm Parabellum during World War Two
        but did not adopt them. Czechosolvakia and Germany have also experimented with steel cases, employing a
        variety of finishes through the 1990s. Copper-washed steel case and lacquered steel case ammunition in
        9mm Parabellum continues to be produced in Russia and is available on the commercial market.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-5">Aluminum</h4>
    <p>Cases made from aluminum have offered another alternative to brass. The earliest production
        of Aluminum case 9mm Parabellum occurred in Switzerland in 1941, again in an attempt to conserve brass.
        Although generally acceptable, and produced in significant quantities, the Swiss production of Aluminum
        cases in 9mm Parabellum ceased in 1945 and was never renewed. France, Belgium and Britain all experi-
        mented with the use of aluminum cases in 9mm during the post war years, with British development continu-
        ing into the mid-1950s. Aluminum cases were never fully successful until the Sporting Equipment Division of
        Omark Industries (CCI) perfected an aluminum case design in their non-reloadable Blazer line of ammuni-
        tion.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-5">Other Material</h4>
    <p>Plastic has been widely used in the production of short range and blank ammunition and
        is available in a varity of colors and from a number of countries. These cases normally have metal heads and
        are illustrated below along with other blank cartridges. Plastic has also been used experimentally to produce
        cases for ball ammunition. There are also experimantal cases made from titanium and from molded powder
        (propellent) which is consumed when the cartridge is fired.</p>

    <h2 id="collecting" class="mt-5">Collecting 9mm Parabellum (Luger) Cartridges</h2>
    <p>The cartridges, headstamps and boxes illustrated in this article represent a tiny fraction of the specimens
        available. In fact the variety seems endless and many collectors limit themselves to a particular era or
        country or some other subset of the 9mm Parabellum universe. The cartridges and headstamps illustrated
        vary from relatively common to extremely rare. You can expect quite a few of the items illustrated to show
        up at gun shows, and more to show up at regional cartridge shows. On the other hand, some of the items
        illustrated are extremely rare and will only be found in the most advanced collections, and a few appear to
        be the sole surviving specimen.</p>
    <p>Regardless of your level of available resources, collecting 9mm cartridges and the associated boxes can be
        an interesting and absorbing subject area with many fascinating avenues for research, and great rarities still waiting to
        be discovered. If you are interested in collecting 9mm Parabellum cartridges, feel free to contact me at

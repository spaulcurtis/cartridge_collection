AFTER POPPY DROP
Decide on how to add new sources and manage sourced.  Decide on Caliber UX
  - Need a whole Source view/template/form stuff to:
    - Full Source CRUD with Source list (with number of references per record type),
      Source detail, Source Form, etc.  Cannot be deleted unless no references
    - Source Detail includes all references in each caliber.
Decide if you get to Source Create from other create/edit models.

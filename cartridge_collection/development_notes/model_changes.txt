Add a country description, and display it on the right on country_details view.
Add a legacy_id.  For now it is unused, but there if anyone needs it in the future.  We could use it for mismarked cartridges.


For legacy ID:
python manage.py shell

from collection.models import Load, Date, Variation, Box

# Load models
for obj in Load.objects.all():
    obj.legacy_id = obj.cart_id
    obj.save()

for obj in Date.objects.all():
    obj.legacy_id = obj.cart_id
    obj.save()

for obj in Variation.objects.all():
    obj.legacy_id = obj.cart_id
    obj.save()

# Box model
for obj in Box.objects.all():
    obj.legacy_id = obj.bid
    obj.save()
